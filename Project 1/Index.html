The post states that "by working together on behalf of New York City children, we can help provide much-needed supports further upstream and reduce the number of unnecessary investigations experienced by Black and Hispanic/Latinx families for far too long."</h5>

Race operates as an indicator of risk for child service agencies.</p>

<p>"We see time and time again that people are more likely to call in cases against black people and people of color than they are against white families. Somebody has to make the decision about whether or not to accept that case. And again, same thing. They're more likely to accept cases against black families than they are against white families." - Siobhan Pokorney, PhD candidate at CUNY Graduate School </p>

<p>The Bronx defenders has filed <a href= "https://www.bronxdefenders.org/the-bronx-defenders-and-arnold-porter-sue-acs-to-stop-its-reign-of-terror-against-new-yorks-most-marginalized-families/#:~:text=The%20Bronx%20Defenders%20v.,families%20they%20purport%20to%20serve.">two lawsuits</a> this year against ACS for its racial bias in operations and the cost it has had on families of color.
